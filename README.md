# Tic-Tac-Toe-AI
It took me a straight 16 hours to entirely revamp my previous program and complete the minimax algorithm. My hands are trembling, but I can now lay my head to sleep.

I use the minimax algorithm to implement the robot character. Alpha-beta pruning is not used in this implementation, however. I would like to implement it in the future, however.

I configured the game so that you can easily play with a friend, a robot, or watch two robots compete against each other if you're into the gladiator scene.

My code is also heavily documented (because I'd like to be able to come back and know what I was doing), so I hope it is understandable to anyone who may find themselves looking at the code.

Tips on how to improve my code is greatly appreciated!

This little project of mine was on the shorter end, but I definitely feel more comfortable with Python.

Hope this project finds you well :-D
