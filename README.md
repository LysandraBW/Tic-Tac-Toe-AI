# Tic-Tac-Toe-AI
It took me a straight 14 hours to entirely revamp my previous program and complete the minmax algorithm. My hands are trembling, but I can now lay my head to sleep.

You can play with a friend, a robot, or watch two robots compete against each other if you're into the gladiator scene.
I use the minmax algorithm to predict the best moves for the robot.
My code is heavily documented, so I hope it is understandable to anyone who may find themselves here.
To the person who may find thenmselves here, please feel free to give me some tips or critiques!

This little project of mine was short and sweet, and I definitely feel more comfortable with Python although I don't know all the ins and outs of the language.
Hope this project finds you well :-D
