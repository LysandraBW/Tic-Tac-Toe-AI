# Tic-Tac-Toe-AI
It took me a straight 16 hours to entirely revamp my previous program and complete the minimax algorithm. My hands are trembling, but I can now lay my head to sleep.

I use the minimax algorithm to implement the robot character. Alpha-beta pruning is not used in this implementation, however. I would like to implement it in the future, however.

I configured the game so that you can easily play with a friend, a robot, or watch two robots compete against each other if you're into the gladiator scene.

My code is also heavily commented/explained (because I'd like to be able to come back and know what I was doing), so I hope it is understandable to anyone who may find themselves looking at the code.

Tips on how to improve my code is greatly appreciated

Hope this project finds you well
